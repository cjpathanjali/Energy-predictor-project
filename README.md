Server-side APIs: Energy Predictor
## The Challenge
Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from open weather  API and using it in the context of their own. Our client  requests us to build a energy predicting platform that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## User Story

```
AS a user,I came to know 
how much power can be generated by the energy  prediction platform,
without wasting the time.


```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a energy platform with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the UV index, solar and windmill power generation.
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I view the visualisation
THEN I can view the line graph for the comparision of solar and wind energy for the next five days
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
``` 

## The Process

To satisfy our client's needs, we had to:
- Create energy platform that updates data based on users' input and selection
- Create HTML file that imports JS Moment library, Bootstrap, CSS file, and JavaScript file
- Provide space theme with our CSS file
- Create JavaScript fetching data from 5 Day Forecast API depending on users' input 
- Provide the power generation using formula for solar and wind 
- Used apexchart to produce the visualisation using above data 
- Modify HTML file to dynamically work with JavaScript file and CSS file

HTML File

```
Import the following library/files:
CSS file, Boostrap Library, Font Awesome Library, Javascript File, Moment, and jQuery Library
```

CSS File

```
Provide a space theme
visualisation chart
Customize preset buttons
Animate five day cards
```
Description
I have attached these file
*index.html;This the html coding for energy predicting platform .you can double click indexfile to open website
*script.js;this is javascipt code used for the backend
*spyle.css;we had imported color, images and giffs
*graph.html;we have imported for visualisation
